This Tic-Tac-Toe code is a two-player console game where players take turns marking spots on a 3x3 grid. It alternates between Player 1 ('X') and Player 2 ('O'), checks for invalid moves, and clears the screen after each turn for a fresh view. The game ends when a player wins, the board fills up, or the user quits. After the game ends, it announces the winner or a draw and thanks the players for playing.
